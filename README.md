# TO DO

### Feedback to server
- implement POST requests
- features:
  - regex checking for validity of questions (warn if failed)
  - correct questions and answers
  - suggest re-categorization
  - suggest sub-categorization (map categories!)
- for now: blindly accept suggestions (can't get much worse anyway)

### Database
- Make it grow!
  - use rest of questions in Excel sheet
  - find new questions online
    - open trivia database
    - Wer wird Million√§r? / Who wants to be a Millionaire?
- Centralize it in a MySQL database. (Docker?)

### Frontend
- on start: label wedges with custom categories
- display "wheel" with six wedge colours on screen
- click wedge to get random question
- if applicable: hide multiple choice answers with optional show

### Documentation
- add comments to script
